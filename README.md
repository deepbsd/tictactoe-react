# React Tic Tac Toe

This project is an extension of my tic tac toe app in vanilla js.  The idea is to 
use the MiniMax algorithm to create an unbeatable AI to play against.

With react, the actual point of playing is to see how the machine decides where
to move.  The best you can do is have a Tie against this AI.  The real payoff
is seeing how an AI thinks!
